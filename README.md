# google-analytics-day-parting
Deploy the use of modulus operators to convert Google Analytics default timestamps of 1-23 hours as standard 12 hour intervals

Note: This is likely easier done with datetime packages and lambda functions, but this repo was intentionally constructed around mod operators for practice :)
